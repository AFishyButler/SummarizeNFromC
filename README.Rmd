# SummarizeCFromN

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SummarizeNFromC is to output a tibble containing the mean, range, and standard deviation of some numerical object as sorted into some category.

## Installation

devtools::install_github("AFishyButler/SummarizeNFromC")

## Example

This is a basic example which shows the basic functionality of the package: a tibble output containing the mean, range, and standard deviation of the diameter of a tree dependent on cultivar.
```{r example}
library(datateachr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(SummarizeCFromN)

(summarize_N_from_C (vancouver_trees, cultivar_name , diameter ))
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:



In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
