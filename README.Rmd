The goal of SummarizeNFromC is to output a tibble containing the mean, range, and standard deviation of some numerical object as sorted into some category.

## Installation

devtools::install_github("AFishyButler/SummarizeNFromC")

## Example

This is a basic example which shows the basic functionality of the package: a tibble output containing the mean, range, and standard deviation of the diameter of a tree dependent on cultivar.
```{r example}
library(datateachr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(SummarizeCFromN)

(summarize_N_from_C (vancouver_trees, cultivar_name , diameter ))
```
